I am a software engineer and aspiring biomedical scientist focused on building and studying complex systems—both computational and biological.

I currently work at the intersection of cloud architecture, AI/ML, and large-scale systems, with over 20 years of experience designing and operating production software for enterprises and startups. In parallel, I am completing a B.S. in Biology at Louisiana State University at Alexandria, where my academic interests include systems biology, endocrinology, metabolism, and aging.

My long-term goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in biomedical sciences and contribute to longevity-focused and translational research, combining experimental biology with computational modeling and machine intelligence.

Outside of research and engineering, I am an endurance athlete (multiple Ironman finishes) and a volunteer with the Trauma Intervention Program, supporting individuals and families during acute crises. These experiences strongly shape my approach to resilience, systems thinking, and human-centered problem solving.
