    "summary": "I'm a systems-level software engineer and architect with 20 years of experience building things that don't fall apart when scaled - payment systems, audio&video streaming solutions, custom hardware platforms deployed in millions of households, and even games back in the day.<br><br>I enjoy solving real problems: making software faster, more reliable, and secure while keeping teams productive and clients happy. My background spans embedded Linux, distributed systems, AI/ML, and modern cloud platforms like AWS and Azure.<br><br>These days, I lead solutions architecture for fintech and enterprise clients at PwC, translating big, often undistilled business goals into systems that actually deliver. Before that, I shipped everything from ERP platforms for global event organizers to voice-driven gaming systems and IoT setups.<br><br>Outside of tech, I'm a science enthusiast and endurance athlete (2x Ironman finisher), which probably explains my obsession with long-term, sustainable systems - both in code and in life.",
