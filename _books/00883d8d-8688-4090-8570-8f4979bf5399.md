In today's cloud native world, where we automate as much as possible, everything is code. With this practical guide, you'll learn how Policy as Code (PaC) provides the means to manage the policies, related data, and responses to events that occur within the systems we maintain—Kubernetes, cloud security, software supply chain security, infrastructure as code, and microservices authorization, among others. Author Jimmy Ray provides a practical approach to integrating PaC solutions into your systems, with plenty of real-world examples and important hands-on guidance.
