This book provides the first comprehensive method for hybrid multicloud security, integrating proven architectural techniques to deliver a comprehensive end-to-end security method with compliance, threat modeling, and zero trust practices. This method ensures repeatability and consistency in the development of secure solution architectures. Architects will learn how to effectively identify threats and implement countermeasures through a combination of techniques, work products, and a demonstrative case study to reinforce learning.
