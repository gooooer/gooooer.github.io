This practical book provides a detailed explanation of the zero trust security model. Zero trust is a security paradigm shift that eliminates the concept of traditional perimeter-based security and requires you to “always assume breach” and “never trust but always verify.” The updated edition offers more scenarios, real-world examples, and in-depth explanations of key concepts to help you fully comprehend the zero trust security architecture.
